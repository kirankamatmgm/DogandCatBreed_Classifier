Classifing cat vs dog is now easy using CNN so classify different breeds of cat and dogs.

I am going to use the [Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/) by [O. M. Parkhi et al., 2012](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/publications/2012/parkhi12a/parkhi12a.pdf) which features 12 cat breeds and 25 dogs breeds. Our model will need to learn to differentiate between these 37 distinct categories.


I got accuracy of 94% which is just 6% error with just few lines of code, when compared to state of art model in 2012 paper which had 56% accuracy.
